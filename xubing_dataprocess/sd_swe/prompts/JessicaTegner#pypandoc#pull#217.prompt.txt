## Hard Rules

1. **No Leakage**: Do **not** quote, paraphrase, summarize, or expose any content from `{PATCH_UNIFIED_DIFF}` or `{TEST_PATCH_UNIFIED_DIFF}`.

2. **Grounding**: All requirements must be **strictly derived** from `{PR_JSON}` + code context at `{BASE_COMMIT_SHA}`. No hallucinated APIs/files/behaviors.

3. **Edit Scope**: The "Files to modify" list in the question must be a **subset of** `{PATCH_METADATA.changed_files}` and should reflect the actual loci of change.

4. **Context Snippets**: If helpful, you may include **small excerpts** from `{ORACLE_FILES}` to illustrate the **pre-change** context only (avoid large blocks). For large references, use link stubs:

   ```

   <github_code_start>https://github.com/Unknown/Unknown/blob/{BASE_COMMIT_SHA}/path/to/file.py#L100-L160</github_code_start>

   ```

5. **Verifiability**: Phrase acceptance criteria so that a grader could verify by applying a correct patch to `{BASE_COMMIT_SHA}` and running the project. Do **not** reveal expected code.

6. **Unsuitable PRs**: If inputs are insufficient (e.g., doc-only/binary-only changes, missing base code), output **only** `BAD_PR` inside the Question block.

## Output Format (produce **only** this block)

````

<|Question Begin|>

Title: {Concise, domain-relevant title}

Scenario (agent-style, production context):

- Briefly describe the real-world motivation and the subsystem involved, derived from {PR_JSON}.

- Keep it practical (e.g., configuration loading, IO pipeline, API contract fix).

Available Materials:

- Base commit: {BASE_COMMIT_SHA}

- Code bundle: {BASE_CODE_TAR_PATH} or {BASE_CODE_DIR}

- Repository: {REPO_METADATA.owner}/{REPO_METADATA.name}

- (Optional) Context excerpts (pre-change) from ORACLE_FILES:

  ```python

  # file: path/to/file.py @ {BASE_COMMIT_SHA}

  # short snippet showing current API/signature/usage relevant to the change

````

Or link stubs:

<github_code_start>[https://github.com/Unknown/Unknown/blob/{BASE_COMMIT_SHA}/path/to/file.py#L120-L168](https://github.com/Unknown/Unknown/blob/{BASE_COMMIT_SHA}/path/to/file.py#L120-L168)</github_code_start>

Your Task:

* Implement the required fix/feature by editing **only** these files:

  * path/to/fileA.py

  * path/to/fileB.json

    (All listed files must be a subset of {PATCH_METADATA.changed_files}.)

* Preserve public contracts unless the change is explicitly required by the scenario.

Functional Requirements:

* Bullet the concrete behaviors expected after the change (input/output, config keys, error handling, edge cases), reconstructed from {PR_JSON}.

* Avoid spoilers (no code, no diff lines, no exact identifiers beyond what exists at base).

Constraints:

* Performance/complexity expectations if implied by the PR (e.g., do not introduce O(N^2) in hot path).

* Backward compatibility or migration notes as applicable.

* Do not modify files outside the scope above.

How We Evaluate:

* Apply the candidate's patch to {BASE_COMMIT_SHA}.

* Run the minimal command(s) to exercise the change (e.g., `python main.py --config path/to/config.json`) and/or project tests if they exist.

* Success signals: specify observable outcomes (logs, CLI output, behavior) without revealing implementation.

Submission Format:

* Submit a unified diff patch that applies cleanly to {BASE_COMMIT_SHA}.

* Do not include compiled artifacts or large assets.

(If the PR is unsuitable or inputs insufficient, output BAD_PR.)

<|Question End|>

```

## Final Instruction

- Output **only** the `<|Question Begin|>…<|Question End|>` block.  

- Do **not** include any additional sections, notes, or explanations.
