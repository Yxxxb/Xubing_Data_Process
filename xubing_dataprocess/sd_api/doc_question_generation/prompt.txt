## Task
Design a **Coding Assessment Question**.
## Objective
As an experienced programming instructor, you are designing programming questions to assess
students' understanding of {PACKAGE_NAME}. Your question should require students to
write code that demonstrates their comprehension of fundamental and advanced concepts of
this package.
## Guidelines
I will provide you with the documentation of {PACKAGE_NAME}. It could be a html, jupyter notebook,
txt, or rst file. Please use it to design the question.
This can be the entire package documentation or a subset of the overall documentation (some packages' full documentation is too long to provide due to context limitations).
You should first analyze the documentation provided and understand the design of the package.
Then, craft a question that is:
* **Challenging** and requires a well-thought-out coding solution.
* **Clear and self-contained**, with all necessary information for solving it provided.
* **Focused on function implementation**, specifying:
* Expected **input and output formats**.
* Any **constraints or limitations**.
* **Performance requirements**, if applicable.
## Output Format
Please use the following output format for consistency.

<|Question Begin|>
[Write the coding question here. If you believe this document is not enough to design a
question, please output "BAD_DOCUMENT" in this section.]
